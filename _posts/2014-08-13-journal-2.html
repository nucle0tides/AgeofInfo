<p class="post_title">As college approaches,</p>
<p class="post_title">for the past week, here I've sat reading,</p>
<div class="post_body">
<p>writing, staring at walls, and thinking-</p>
<p>Life doesn't care for me,</p>
<p>nor should I care for it.</p>
<p>Instead, I just need to laugh at it.</p>
<p>Laugh as it steals what I had stolen,</p>
<p>and slowly, but inevitably,</p>
<p>takes me back home to dust.</p>
</div>
