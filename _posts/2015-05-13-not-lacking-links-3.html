<h4><a title="Study: Partisans treat politics like sports, valuing a team over issues" href="http://theweek.com/speedreads/550850/study-partisans-treat-politics-like-sports-valuing-team-over-issues" target="_blank">"Study: Partisans treat politics like sports, valuing a team over issues"</a></h4>
<p>Turns out most core voters go out to show Democrats/Republicans a lesson rather than actually caring about the issue they vote on.</p>

<h4><a title="Netflix Sets Its Prices According to Local Piracy Rates" href="http://gizmodo.com/netflix-sets-its-prices-according-to-local-piracy-rates-1698622185" target="_blank">Netflix is adjusting its user fees based on the piracy rate in a region</a></h4>
<p>This follows the trend of streaming services reducing piracy rates by providing goods at prices consumers are willing to pay for (duh). In other words, if piracy was not a feasible practice, most 'pirates' would not purchase the music/movies they pirate now if given no other option.</p>
<h4><a title="An investigation of the false discovery rate and the misinterpretation of p-values" href="http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/1/3/140216" target="_blank">Paper shows how people still do not understand how statistics work</a></h4>
<p>The Royal Society published a paper a year ago on how students and teachers alike continue to mis-interpret the meaning of P-Value tests and values. Furthermore, they advise people to avoid the word 'significance' in order to prevent future false discoveries.</p>
<h4><a title="How Some Men Fake an 80-Hour Workweek, and Why It Matters" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/05/upshot/how-some-men-fake-an-80-hour-workweek-and-why-it-matters.html?abt=0002&amp;abg=0" target="_blank">Men fake 80 hour work weeks in corporate America</a></h4>
<p>A study published in Organization Science shows how males at a global consultancy firm must lie in order to spend quality time with their families, while females have an easier time at getting time off and/or leniency to spend time with family members. While the study is not comprehensive, it speaks volumes for the work culture that exists in high level corporate America.</p>
