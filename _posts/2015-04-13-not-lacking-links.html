<p>Last week's miscellanea:</p>
<h4><a title="Walter Scott Death: Bystander Who Recorded Cop Shooting Speaks Out" href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/walter-scott-shooting/man-who-recorded-walter-scott-being-shot-speaks-out-n338126" target="_blank">Witness of Walter Scott's murder speaks out</a></h4>
<p>Feidin Santana was the individual that recorded the brutal murder of Walter Scott, an unarmed 50 y.o. black male, by a North Carolina police officer and has come out to give a full testimony of the event that day. He also talked about how he was fearful of turning in the recording because of how police treat video witnesses. A good example would be Eric Garner's case, <a title="Ramsey Orta, who videotaped the Eric Garner chokehold death, released from jail on a drug rap after his bail is raised online " href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/videotaper-garner-chokehold-death-sprung-jail-article-1.2180912" target="_blank">where Ramsey Orta, the recorder of Garner's death, got arrested by the NYPD shortly after for unrelated charges</a>. Hopefully by the end of this tragedy Walter Scott's family will see justice served because of Santana's courage.</p>
<h4><a title=" Sashimani Devi, last human consort of the god Jagannath, died on March 19th, aged 92" href="http://www.economist.com/news/obituary/21647583-sashimani-devi-last-human-consort-god-jagannath-died-march-19th-aged-92-marriage" target="_blank">Death of a god's wife</a></h4>
<p>Obituary for Sashimani Devi, the "last human consort of the god Jagannath", the Economist -- For as much as I use it to keep updated on politics, my favorite section of the Economist is possibly its obituaries. Never failing wit and always fascinating topics, the Economist's obituaries are some of the best writing you can find. This week's edition marks an end of an era for humanity and India alike, and in my opinion, managed to be quite bittersweet.</p>

<p>If you like to make your internet browsing as secure and private as possible, I recommend using the Electronic Frontier Foundation's extension 'HTTPS Everywhere' on Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Android. It forces websites to use HTTPS when they have the option available, meaning you have a more secure connection with your host. As usual, it is far from a guarantee and it will create some bugs on certain websites. My personal experience so far has been solid, and the only problem I have had is when connecting to free WiFi provided by Starbucks. First disable the extension, connect to Starbucks &amp; accept their ToE, and then re-enable the extension.</p>
<h4><a title="Half of urban California’s water is used to water the grass" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/half-of-urban-californias-water-is-used-to-water-the-grass-2015-04-02?siteid=rss&amp;rss=1" target="_blank">People are still focusing on the urban use of water</a></h4>
<p>I think I have written enough on it, but if I am not clear enough: Focusing on only 20% of California's water consumption will not solve the problem. The problem begins with the farmers, and only by fixing how they use water will we really see any long-term change and sustainability. Also:</p>
<h4><a title="The Economics of Water(And other Diversions)" href="http://www.aguanomics.com/" target="_blank">Aquanomics, the blog dedicated to public resource/Water based economics</a></h4>
<p>I already borrow a lot of my thinking from David Zetland, so it is time to make sure I make my connection clear. Go read his blog, the guy knows what he is talking about.</p>
<h4><a title="Rolling Stone’s investigation: ‘A failure that was avoidable" href="http://www.cjr.org/investigation/rolling_stone_investigation.php?1428283910525=1" target="_blank">The Rolling Stone rescinds its expose on college rape culture</a></h4>
<p>The Rolling Stone hired out Columbia's journalism school to do an independent investigation into the magazine's protocol in reporting the recent accusation of a gang rape on the University of Virginia's campus. Besides showing how the Rolling Stone should not be trusted for hard-hitting journalism, people should also realize that this does not take away legitimacy from the reality of rape. Simultaneously, it shows how we must respect due process, less we accidentally ruin someone's life as well. It is not fun being moderate and controlled over such tragic issues, but that is exactly why due process is a thing to start with. Sadly, I think activists on both sides are creating a false dichotomy between taking rape seriously and protecting due process.</p>
<h4><a title="Microsoft’s Mark Russinovich: An open source Windows is ‘definitely possible’" href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/04/03/microsofts-mark-russinovich-an-open-source-windows-is-definitely-possible/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Venturebeat+%28VentureBeat%29" target="_blank">Windows Open Source?</a></h4>
<p>Microsoft has already promised a free upgrade to everyone who already uses Windows, including pirated copies, but becoming open source seems more like science fiction to me. The article clarifies how Microsoft is becoming more open with its software in some instances, but overall, it definitely remains proprietary and closed.</p>
<h4><a title="The Man with the Iron Fists 2 - Trailer - Own it on Blu-ray 4/14 " href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcbYBZsklGQ" target="_blank">RZA totally releases his new Kung-Fu movie</a></h4>
<p>Rza, the head of the Wu Tang Clan, releases his movie Iron Fist 2. Get ready for a movie with a sick soundtrack and some decent cinematography.</p>
